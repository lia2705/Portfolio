                    Design Against the COVID-19 Blues: <br>
                    The spread of the COVID-19 pandemic led many countries to impose strict lockdown measures on their citizens. As a result, a large part of the population experienced significant stress and psychological strain. Adjusting to new routines and finding inner balance became key to maintaining good mental health in this situation.
                    The organization Mental Health Europe is looking for a solution that could help people in need.
                    A way must be found to support individuals struggling with their mental health as they transition into an “untact” era.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- STEP 2 -->
            <div class="step step2">
                <p> 
                First, we needed to clearly define the problem we wanted to solve.
                    To do this, we used various tools such as empathy maps, scenario maps, and big-idea vignettes to identify possible situations in which users might feel helpless, stressed, or even panicked. Our goal was to counteract these situations with our app. <br>
                    We created a persona: Alessa Miller, a 31-year-old sales employee who, after spending a long period working from home, has begun to experience symptoms of social anxiety—especially during presentations.
                    <br><br> Our design mission is to support people like her during moments of overwhelming fear and help them overcome their challenges. At this stage, we decided on the name “HOW,” derived from the question “How can I solve my problem?”
                    Our vision with HOW is to help people regain a better sense of well-being.
                    <br><br> After extensive research, we chose the following features:
                    education through lessons and exercises, reflection and habit tracking, emergency assistance, and the use of artificial intelligence.
                    <br> Our USP lies in the individualized adaptation to each user, a simple and intuitive interface, and long-term helpful courses developed in collaboration with psychologists—all brought together in one app.
                </p>

                <div class="stage2">
                    <h1>02 </h1>
                    <h4>Design Mission</h4>
                </div>
            </div>

            <!-- STEP 3 -->
            <div class="step3">
                <h2>03 Design Process </h2>
                <!-- 3.1 INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE -->
                <div class="stage3">
                    <div class="stage3-left">
                         <h4>3.1 Information Architecture</h4>
                        <div class="sitemap-image"><img src="pictures/HOW-Project/sitemap.png" alt="Sitemap"></div>
                    </div>

                    <p>However, we quickly realized that we had too many ideas we 
                        wanted to integrate into our app. We were trying to develop 
                        an app that would help everyone in every possible way. 
                        <br><br> Because of that, we had to redefine our USP several times. 
                        To do so, we not only created additional personas to identify 
                        the exact pain points of our target group, but also conducted 
                        surveys to find out which features our potential users would consider helpful.
                        <br><br> After removing several features, we created our first sitemap and 
                        developed paper prototypes based on it.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <!-- 3.3 REDO FEATURES -->
                 <div class="stage3">
                    <div class="stage3-fullscreen-text">
                         <h4>3.3 Refine features</h4>
                         <p>The feedback on our paper prototypes was mixed. We still had too many features, which led us to rethink the MVP of our app.
                        <br><br> We realized that the SOS button could serve as the app’s main feature and received the suggestion to use a metaphor for the learning map, such as a road trip.
                        The first screen the user sees should be the most important screen of our app — which wasn’t the case with our previous information architecture.
                        <br><br>As a result, we began to redesign the app from the ground up. <br>
                        We changed our navigation from a tab bar to a one-page application and further reduced our features: we removed the personalized feed and journaling to focus more on the Learnmap and the SOS function.
                        With these changes, we also had to redefine our USP: guidance for self-discovery.

                        <p>For our brand ethos, we chose ‘the journey is the goal.’ 
                            The process you go through to reach an objective is just as
                            meaningful as the objective itself. With HOW, we want to support
                            and enrich each user’s personal journey. <br><br>
                            In the next step, we developed a design system and used it as 
                            the foundation for designing the first screens.
